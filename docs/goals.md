Project Goals
=============

Even if your project looks awesome, if your team's process was poor then it's not going to have been a great outcome for you, and your time spent working on it is likely to be far less enjoyable.

With this in mind, coaches will be looking for a few things from you as a measure of how well your team is working.

------

## Testing

- 90% or greater test coverage.
- Unit tests:
  - test one piece of your own logic.
  - fail if that logic breaks.
  - pass if it that logic produces the expected result.
  - You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
  - Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.


## Good distribution of work

- Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team can:
  - explain _why_ any part of the application exists (what user need it solves).
  - explain _how_ any aspect of the application works.

- Every member of the team has made commits.
- Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request.


## Quality of work

- Commit messages are clear and composed of:
  - a single line describing the changes made.
  - a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user.

- The Linter passes on all commits.
- All commits have a low complexity score.
- All pull requests are peer reviewed.


## Documentation

- There is up-to-date documentation:
  - a project description.
  - how to install and run it.
  - how to run tests.

It's also a great idea for your team to keep some sort of record of your learning process. This could take the form of a blog, a wiki or any other format you like.


## Additional Criteria â€“ Weeks 8 and 9 (Engineering Projects)

- Merging any branch into `master` automatically deploys after passing automated tests.
- All code on `master` is containerized (optional).
- `master` is deployed into production.
