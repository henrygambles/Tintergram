# Sprint 1

Get together earlier to share problems and more complex aspects of the application, so we can mob to unblock

Progressed some complex aspects really well (e.g. testing devise user setup)

Mob earlier if possible (although our 4pm mob was successful)

Spend time-boxed time learning specific concepts as a pair/team during each sprint
